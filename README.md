In this assignment, I built a website of a portfolio for myself, supplying some pictures to show off my work. The links should take you around the page at the top and hopefully you can be linked as well to some of the sites below in my contact. Thank you for taking the time to grade this! This was a hard assignment to try to get flex to work properly. I hope to get more chances to get some of the functions down in future projects. Thanks in advance!
